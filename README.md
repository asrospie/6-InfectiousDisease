# Infectious Diseases: Cellular Automata by Quaranteam

The app will be similar to Conway's Game of Life. However, instead of simulating life, the app will simulate infectious disease by having more than two states and objects, air, and people can contract the disease.  While there are more rules to discuss and define, the main one is that contagious people, surfaces, and areas can infect other people, surfaces, and areas.  Players will also be able to set their own rules and parameters, as well as continue current games and review past games' data.
